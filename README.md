> Be more productive with latex-macros, a set of plug-and-play functions.

In `macros.tex` are defined many new commands ready to use in a tex
source in order to simplify the usage of latex. You can find many
math, semantics, sets, and other symbols as well as functions and
commands.

Please refer to the [documentation]() for installation, usage and 
available macros.
